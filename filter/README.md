# Filter Plugins

The _filter plugins_ allows to **alter** the incoming data generated by the _input plugins_. As of this version the following filter plugins are available:

| name | title | description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [grep](grep.md) | Grep | Match or exclude specific records by patterns. |
| [kubernetes](kubernetes.md) | Kubernetes | Enrich logs with Kubernetes Metadata. |
| [lua](lua.md) | Lua | Filter records using Lua Scripts. |
| [parser](parser.md) | Parser | Parse record. |
| [record\_modifier](record_modifier.md) | Record Modifier | Modify record. |
| [stdout](stdout.md) | Stdout | Print records to the standard output interface. |
| [throttle](throttle.md) | Throttle | Apply rate limit to event flow. |
| [nest](nest.md) | Nest | Nest records under a specified key |
| [modify](modify.md) | Modify | Modifications to record. |

In order to let a Filter be applied over some data, the **Match** rule must exists and it must match the Tag for the incoming data.

And where, pray tell, does the filter plugins section live?  Does it have its own section title?  If so, what that might be?  If not, then under which other title does it reside?   And where does that section go?  In the main configuration file -- parsers aren't allowed there I've learned via pure trial and error.  Or does it go in the parsers file?  Or somewhere else yet again?  Learning to use this tool is like driving blind.  Better documentation would help.
